## Features

Using Reach, a smart contract build, deploy, test, execute workflow is achieved. The dApp is able to deploy smart contracts to the network, and interact with it to not only query view data, but also perform interactions with the deployed contract.

This submission exhibits the reach concepts of:
- Paying to/from a smart contract
- Privacy based interactions (passwords)
- Timeouts
- Waiting
- View functions

The front end employs heavy use of react hooks on the retrieved chain data, to deliver a fully usable App.
