# Brief
As part of the Lunar Ascent bootcamp for reach, this is an individual submission. *GIFTED* is a dApp which allows MetaMask users connected to the Sepolia (eth testnet) network to send gifts to one another.

This dApp has been deployed and can be found at:
[https://ornate-arithmetic-263078.netlify.app/](https://ornate-arithmetic-263078.netlify.app/)

# Setup

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

> ℹ️ And then navigate your favourite web browser to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

## Features

Using Reach, a smart contract build, deploy, test, execute workflow is achieved. The dApp is able to deploy smart contracts to the network, and interact with it to not only query view data, but also perform interactions with the deployed contract.

This submission exhibits the reach concepts of:
- Paying to/from a smart contract
- Privacy based interactions (passwords)
- Timeouts
- Waiting
- View functions
